# burger

This app demonstrates a full stack web app, using node express as a server for developement, deployed on Heroku.

If you type in a hamburger that name data will be stored into a mysql database and if you clicked the devoured button it will update a boolean value tied to the database then change the frontend to validate the change.


add a new burger to see it work properly as the boolean value does not default back to zero upon reload.. this is a fix i will update
